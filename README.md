# Network Intrusion Detection and Attack Classification using UNSW-NB15 Dataset 

Contains Exploratory Data Analysis Files, Network Intrusion Detection and Attack Classification Models for problem described below - 

Network intrusion detection and attack categorization is a field of active research but a major problem faced by researchers is the unavailability of datasets that simulate modern day network traffic. There are several other datasets available such as the KD98, KDDCUP99 ( KDD Cup 1999 Data ) which were generated with the aim of developing network intrusion detection systems that could detect the difference between “bad” network intrusions and “good” network connections but these datasets were generated around 2 decades ago and do not adequately represent network traffic generated by modern day computers.

The UNSW-NB15 data set was created with the intention of bridging this gap.

The data-set contains 9 types of attacks namely Fuzzers, Analysis, Backdoors, DoS, Exploits, Generic, Reconnaissance, Shellcode and Worms.

In the ipynb files, a detailed EDA is performed along with designing and analysis performance of various Network Intrusion Detection and Attack Classification models.
